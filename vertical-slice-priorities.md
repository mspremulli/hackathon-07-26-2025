# Vertical Slice Development Priorities

## Goal: Get a working demo ASAP, then enhance

---

## Engineer 1: Core Infrastructure Lead

### FIRST PRIORITY (2 hours) - Get Basic Flow Working
**Deliverable**: Agents can communicate and generate a recommendation

1. **Simple Senso.ai Integration** (45 min)
   ```javascript
   // Just get data in and out
   const senso = new SensoClient(API_KEY);
   await senso.ingest({ type: 'insight', data: salesData });
   const context = await senso.query({ startup_id: '123' });
   ```

2. **Basic Agent Coordinator** (45 min)
   ```javascript
   // Simple orchestration without Orkes initially
   async function runAnalysis() {
     const results = await Promise.all([
       salesAgent.analyze(),
       productAgent.analyze(),
       marketAgent.analyze()
     ]);
     return synthesize(results);
   }
   ```

3. **Mock Learning Loop** (30 min)
   ```javascript
   // Fake but convincing improvement metrics
   let accuracy = 0.45;
   function simulateImprovement() {
     accuracy = Math.min(accuracy * 1.15, 0.92);
     return { before: 0.45, current: accuracy };
   }
   ```

### SECOND PRIORITY (2 hours) - Add Sophistication
4. **Orkes Workflow Integration**
   - Replace Promise.all with proper Orkes workflows
   - Add retry logic and error handling
   - Visual workflow monitoring

5. **Real Learning Implementation**
   - Track actual recommendations and outcomes
   - Implement threshold adjustments
   - Store learning events in Senso

## Engineer 2: Business Intelligence Lead

### FIRST PRIORITY (2 hours) - Get One Real Insight
**Deliverable**: Live Mixpanel query showing a real pattern

1. **Mixpanel MCP Connection** (45 min)
   ```javascript
   // Get demo account access first!
   const mixpanelMCP = new MixpanelMCP(DEMO_TOKEN);
   const insight = await mixpanelMCP.query({
     natural_language: "What features drive retention?"
   });
   ```

2. **One Working Agent** (45 min)
   ```javascript
   class ProductAnalyticsAgent {
     async findKeyInsight() {
       // Just need ONE good insight for demo
       const retention = await mixpanel.query("retention by feature");
       return {
         insight: "Users who use Feature X retain 3x better",
         confidence: 0.85
       };
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Mock Sales Data with Story** (30 min)
   ```javascript
   // Create compelling fake CRM data
   const salesData = {
     pattern: "Enterprise deals mentioning 'compliance' close 3x faster",
     examples: ["Acme Corp", "TechCo", "BigBank"],
     avgDealSize: "$125k"
   };
   ```

### SECOND PRIORITY (2 hours) - Enhance Intelligence
4. **LlamaIndex Knowledge Graph**
   - Visualize discovered patterns
   - Show relationships between insights
   - Make it look impressive

5. **Datadog Performance Metrics**
   - Track query performance
   - Show agent efficiency improving
   - Add to dashboard

---

## Engineer 3: Experience & Market Intel Lead

### FIRST PRIORITY (2 hours) - Get UI Running with One Alert
**Deliverable**: Dashboard showing agents working + one Bright Data alert

1. **Basic Dashboard UI** (1 hour)
   ```html
   <!-- Just needs to look good and update -->
   <div class="agent-status">
     <div class="agent" data-status="analyzing">Sales Agent</div>
     <div class="agent" data-status="complete">Product Agent</div>
   </div>
   <div class="recommendations">
     <!-- Live updates here -->
   </div>
   ```

2. **Bright Data MCP Setup** (30 min)
   ```javascript
   // One working market signal
   const brightData = new BrightDataMCP();
   const alert = await brightData.monitor({
     query: "competitor layoffs",
     realTime: true
   });
   ```

3. **Fake Improvement Metrics** (30 min)
   ```javascript
   // Animated "Agent IQ" that increases
   let agentIQ = 143;
   setInterval(() => {
     agentIQ += Math.random() * 2;
     updateDisplay(agentIQ);
   }, 5000);
   ```

### SECOND PRIORITY (2 hours) - Add Polish
4. **Vapi Voice Integration**
   - "Your AI advisor has 3 insights"
   - Triggered by button in UI
   - Makes demo memorable

5. **Mastra + Arcade Polish**
   - Smooth animations
   - Interactive elements
   - Professional appearance

## Integration Checkpoints

### After 1 Hour - Basic Integration Test
- Eng 1: Can accept data from other agents?
- Eng 2: Can send one insight?
- Eng 3: Can display one recommendation?
**If YES**: Continue building
**If NO**: Debug together for 15 min

### After 2 Hours - Demo Run-Through
- Full flow: Data → Insight → Recommendation → Display
- Should have at least one "wow" moment working
- Practice the narrative

### After 3 Hours - Polish Sprint
- Add sponsor integrations that are working
- Enhance visualizations
- Prepare backup plans

### After 4 Hours - Final Demo Prep
- Lock the code
- Practice 3-minute demo
- Assign speaking roles

---

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Don't Block Each Other**
   - Use mock data interfaces
   - Agree on data formats early
   - Work on different files

2. **Demo-Driven Development**
   - If it's not in the demo, skip it
   - Fake it convincingly if needed
   - Focus on the story

3. **Sponsor Integration Priority**
   ```
   MUST HAVE: Senso + Mixpanel + Bright Data (one from each engineer)
   NICE TO HAVE: Everything else
   ```

4. **The Story Arc**
   - Minute 1: "Executives are drowning in data"
   - Minute 2: "Our agents discover hidden insights"
   - Minute 3: "And they get smarter every day"

## Emergency Pivots

### If Mixpanel MCP Fails
- Use mock data but make it compelling
- Show the query interface at least
- Focus on the learning aspect

### If Bright Data MCP Fails
- Pre-recorded competitor alert
- Focus on internal insights
- Still counts as "attempted integration"

### If Nothing Integrates
- Beautiful UI with convincing mock data
- Focus on continuous improvement story
- Emphasize the architecture and potential

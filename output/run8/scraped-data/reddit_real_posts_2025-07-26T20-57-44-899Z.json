      "text": "I made a fake online store that helps people fight shopping addiction\nAlright so this is either the dumbest idea of all time or something that will actually help people stop giving their money to these corporations that are actively trying to make their sites as addicting as possible while the quality goes down and prices go up....\n\nHomepage Demo Image: https://imgur.com/a/kePtnIy\n\nThe idea is to give people the dopamine hit of shopping without the guilt or wasted money. You browse, you add to cart, you checkout but it‚Äôs all fake. No charges, no packages, just a safe way to scratch the itch when you‚Äôre tempted to impulse buy something dumb at 2AM.\n\nI‚Äôm also building a Chrome extension that pops up when you get to checkout on real sites like Amazon and asks, ‚ÄúAre you sure you really want to buy this?‚Äù kind of like a digital accountability buddy.\n\nI added in a screenshot of the interface I have so far now it's all fueled from my own self funding to generate a ton of images, products, and descriptions.\n\nI've put a ton of time into it so far and want to see if this tool would actually be helpful. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated and happy to add you to the beta launch if there's enough interest for me to finish. Also, it will all be free!\n\nUPDATE 1:\n\nWow. I did not expect this kind of response. Thank you all so much for your feedback, stories, and honesty have completely reshaped how I view this project and where it can go! What started as a small side project to help curb compulsive spending has turned into something much more serious. After reading your comments, it‚Äôs clear. This isn‚Äôt just about resisting consumerism, it's about healing.\n\nFrom ADHD, impulse control, and dopamine-seeking behaviors to compulsive shopping and the financial toll it takes‚Ä¶ People are really struggling and being preyed on by companies who optimize everything to keep you spending.\n\nOne comment that really stuck with me:\n \"I‚Äôm a school social worker and I have a parent on my caseload who needs this so bad‚Ä¶ In her case, all the needless shopping is destroying her finances and destabilizing her household.\" - Mysterious_Luck7122\n\nThis project is now being built as a therapeutic tool for people with shopping addiction, ADHD, anxiety, and more.\n\nWe simulate the dopamine rush of online shopping. Adding items to a cart, seeing reviews, discounts, checkout buttons but nothing is ever purchased. It‚Äôs a safe outlet to break the loop of overspending without judgment or risk.\n\nSo here's what I'm doing next:\n\n- www.justbuynothing.com - I went ahead and purchased this domain to host the initial beta of the site. Right now, it‚Äôs just a standard coming soon page. I was going to add a waitlist for emails to notify users when it‚Äôs ready but didn‚Äôt want you to think I was taking any of your information or data so I‚Äôll stick to keeping everyone updated on Reddit for now.\n\n- Within the next week or two, I‚Äôll turn the site on to show you what I have completed so far and would love any feedback and recommendations. The Chrome Extension will also be available to test. \n\n- I need your help. I want this to be open source! I'm doing this solo right now and could really use help from actual developers, designers, mental health professionals, ADHD/impulse experts, copywriters, UX thinkers and really anyone who resonates with the mission. We are not here to make money, we want to help people who are struggling. Please send me over a DM if you‚Äôre interested. I would love for this to be a team built from Redditors who share my views. \n\nGitHub Page: https://github.com/JustBuyNothing/JustBuyNothingApp\n*Only missing assets still trying to find a way to upload them all\n\nHere‚Äôs what‚Äôs planned so far:\n- Dopamine-hit cart building (no cost, no shipping, no actual orders)\n- Chrome Extension - when you click the checkout button on Amazon you get an are you sure type message with the amount of money you can save by just going back to Buy Nothing. \n- Optional profiles to save carts\n- ‚ÄúMindful Mode‚Äù toggle with supportive prompts\n- Resource center (non-predatory financial &amp; mental health guides)\n- Optional email/SMS support (fake deals, tips, reminders opt-in only)\n\nFuture Ideas Thanks to All of You!\n- Continue adding categories and products to fully address what all of our users are interested in. We want them to feel like they are actually shopping and searching for something they want.\n- Fake credit card with a fake limit - shoutout to sarnianibbles!\n- Adding in a game function to the site - shoutout to poddy_fries!\n- Ability to donate to charities that help individuals this site is made for - shoutout to return_of_the_badger!\n- Optional email/SMS support (fake deals, tips, reminders opt-in only, promo codes)\n- There‚Äôs a ton of feedback I‚Äôll keep on adding and adding the possibilities are endless.\n\nThank you again for all the insight and stories! You‚Äôve opened my eyes to how many people need a tool like this.\n\nLet‚Äôs build it together.\n\nBonus picture of my dog for a serotonin boost today: https://imgur.com/a/8v8S1mk",

      "text": "[Rant] Rejected in 15 minutes by CEO after 4 rounds and days of work\nTotally frustrated and needed to let this out.\n\nI am a new grad, Dec 2024, with some years of work experience. I have been applying like crazy and finally got an interview with a company, and I thought that ‚ÄúFinally, I might land this job as I cleared 4 rounds‚Äù. But bro, this one totally broke me.\n\nHere‚Äôs how it went:\n\n1. **HR call** ‚Äì pretty standard.\n2. **Online assessment** ‚Äì did well - JavaScript, node.js, SQL questions and 2 LeetCode questions\n3. **Home Assignment** ‚Äì spent DAYS on this. I built a full-stack review dashboard for customer reviews approval by manager and integrated it with their main website to match the UI/UX (not their production app, just matched exact same UI and CSS and made a separate page to show it working).. Added other features also. Discussed it in-depth with the CTO (1-hour technical discussion).\n4. **Follow-up Round** ‚Äì  1-hour technical with the CTO. For this round, he asked me to implement OpenAI API for text analysis of reviews and auto-suggestions based on customer feedback. I thought it went well as he was happy with my work and told me to prepare for next round.\n5. **Final Boss The CEO Round** ‚Äì I was asked a system design question (LLD) around 3rd-party APIs. I started explaining my thought process.... then he just abruptly ended it with a \"have a nice day\" after 15 minutes. No feedback. No explanation. Just gone.\n\nNo idea what went wrong. After the interview, I was sitting on my chair, totally numb and thinking that I just spent 20+ hours building a working AI tool for you and in just 15 minutes got a sweet rejection.\n\nI am so much drained and frustrated. That home assignment alone took so many days. I researched and studied so many things for the assessment. Today, I feel burned out and feel like leaving the software industry. Don't know when this cycle of unemployment will end. üò≠üò≠üò≠üò´\n\nAnyway, just needed a place to vent this out.\n\nThanks for reading. Back to the grind üòí",

No review exchanges. Just a lot of sweat, late-night bug fixes, and learning how to build real trust with store owners.\n\nHere‚Äôs what worked for us (might help others launching apps in a competitive space):\n\t‚Ä¢\tFast, human support. We responded to every message like it was urgent. Not automated replies. Real conversations.\n\t‚Ä¢\tWe didn‚Äôt ask for reviews blindly. Only after someone clearly saw value, we‚Äôd send a short link and thank them for the feedback.\n\t‚Ä¢\tWe shipped something new almost every week. Even small UX fixes made a difference.\n\t‚Ä¢\tEvery 4-star review got a follow-up. We reached out personally and often learned something that helped improve the app.\n\nOur app focuses on one specific pain point: abandoned carts. We decided to own that niche instead of being a jack-of-all-trades.\n\nHappy to share the link to our App Store listing if anyone‚Äôs curious ‚Äî and open to questions if you‚Äôre working on your own launch!",

      "text": "The absolute state of Uber Eats (delivery guy perspective)\n-----------------------------------------------\nBACKGROUND:\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nSo I lost my job and accommodation in March. \n\nThe last few months have been a mad scramble to try and sort my life out. \n\nJobs are non existent right now.\n\nI've heard nothing but horror stories about what it's like to go on Job Seekers, so have avoided applying for any benefit, no matter the cost.\n\nConsequently, this period has depleted all my life savings and I've survived by borrowing money from friends and family to the tune of $12k+.\n\nI've now ended up doing Uber Eats delivery to survive and try to pay back my debts. \n\nIn these last few weeks doing UE in Auckland i offer the following insights:\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nUBER EATS EARNINGS:\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThere are hundreds of us delivery guys in Auckland all competing for the same few orders.\n\nUber can thus afford to reduce the earnings per delivery because it knows we are desperate enough to accept any crumbs we can get. \n\nThey are paying us around $4 - $7 for most deliveries. Occasionally there's a better one, but it's not consistent. \n\nPetrol we have to pay ourselves, at around $0.16 - $0.20 per km. For most deliveries that cuts our already low earnings in half. \n\nDue to traffic and long wait times at restaurants, it usually takes at least half an hour to do one delivery and come back.\n\nSo we are lucky if we get to do 3 deliveries per hour.\n\nDue to the sheer number of competing UE drivers, we can often sit for hours in the car, waiting for any orders to come through. \n\nThe only way for Uber to be a viable source of income is to work 12 hour days, every single day without any time off, after which we are taking home about $120 per day after tax, ACC and petrol.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nTIPS:\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nI know that kiwis hate tipping. I know we don't want to create a culture of tip dependence that rewards companies for underpaying their staff.\n\nHowever, the economy is in the toilet and if you are lucky enough to be able to afford Uber Eats delivery, you surely can afford an extra cpl $$ for the poor schmuck who drives around at 3am to bring you your late night Maccas.\n\nPlease consider how lucky you are to have a job right now, and try to spread the love just a little bit. \n\n-----------------------------------------------\nDRIVER FEEDBACK:\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nEven if you can't or won't tip, at the very least it costs you nothing to leave positive feedback for your driver. \n\nAfter hundreds of deliveries, only 16 ppl have left me a thumbs up.\n\nAnd pls never leave a thumbs down for your driver because 99% of the time, it's not their fault the order arrives late. \n\nFor us, time is money. We want to do as many orders as possible. There is no incentive for us to bugger around. If your food takes a bit longer, it is either due to traffic or the restaurant being busy. Please direct your outrage to customer support or the restaurant, instead of punishing the poor driver who did everything correctly on his end.\n\nBad reviews cause us to lose ranking in the Uber app, which results in us being de-prioritised and thus receiving fewer orders.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nJAMES THE CUNT\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nI want to give a special shout out to the absolute cunt named James, who at 4am last night gave me a negative review, because he waited just an extra few minutes for his order. \n\nThis happened because the shop was literally busy at that time, and staffed by only 1 poor guy who was running like hell to get multiple orders done asap.\n\nBut James kept rolling his eyes at me, and couldn't believe a word of this explanation, and gave me a thumbs down anyway.\n\nThis has resulted in me dropping to a lower tier in the Uber app, which will now reduce my payouts and frequency of orders received. \n\nJames, I hope you feel satisfied, destroying other people's lives from your position of comfort and privilege.\n\nTo everyone else, please don't be like James.\n\nThank you.",

      "text": "What is going on at Plex HQ?\nIs it just me, or is there a vague shift in Plex that seems illogical from the outside?\n\n- The change in Plex Pass/remote streaming: A huge point of debate amongst users atm. IMHO, not terrible on it's own, but arguably poorly handled from a PR point of view.  \n- Broken app update: a broken app that seems like it's been pushed way too early and seemingly no acknowledgement from the Plex team.  \n- Full steam ahead with the new app: Despite the poor reception of the broken app, they are going to release it on more platforms that are harder to rollback to the old one.  \n- App reviews from the devs: technically against ToS to review your own product, unethical to do so without declaring your conflict of interest.\n\nThere are some rumours about staff cut backs or developers that can't understand the code of the previous app. I've even seen some people comment that they've vibecoded the new app. Rumours aside, what is going on? Do we have any concrete evidence to explain the odd shift in quality? Do Plex actually review user feedback, and if so why are they very quiet right now?\n\n(for those who don't know, vibecoding is a euphemism for copying and pasting LLM AI produced code until you get something that seems to work.)\n\nEdit:  \nSomething I've just noticed, all the posts in this subreddit are getting downvoted if they have any reference to app issues, or getting around plex remote access. Not even criticisms, just people asking for help or information on how to use a VPN to circumnavigate remote access. This post was downvoted to zero in the first 15 seconds of me posting it. Is Plex astroturfing?",

      "text": "Yourselfirst App Review: Seeking Feedback on Performance and Support Issues\n I‚Äôm sharing my experience with the app, which I‚Äôve been using for about a month to explore self-discovery and personal growth. I was drawn to its promises of personality tests and tailored journeys, but my experience has been disappointing due to several issues. I‚Äôm hoping to hear others‚Äô reviews or get feedback on whether I‚Äôm missing something to make this app work better.\n\nHere‚Äôs a breakdown of my experience:\n\n1. App Performance Problems: The interface feels sluggish, and I‚Äôve encountered freezes during tests. One time, the app logged me out, and I lost my progress. I‚Äôm on an iPhone 12 with the latest iOS, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs my device. Have others had similar performance issues in their reviews?\n2. Vague Test Results: I took tests like Personality and Self-Esteem, but the feedback was too general, like ‚Äúyou could improve in social settings.‚Äù I expected more detailed insights since the app promotes self-awareness. Has anyone received more specific feedback from these tests?\n3. Journeys Lack Impact: I‚Äôm halfway through the 28-day Self-Discipline journey, but the daily tasks (e.g., ‚Äúwrite down one goal‚Äù) feel generic and unrelated to my test results. I‚Äôm not seeing value so far. Do any reviews mention completing a journey that felt worthwhile?\n4. Unresponsive Support: I reached out to support twice about crashes but haven‚Äôt gotten a response after two weeks. The lack of live chat or phone support makes it tough to resolve issues. Has anyone had better feedback from their support team?\n\nI really wanted to like this app because the idea of a centralized self-improvement tool is great, but these issues are making it hard to stick with. I‚Äôm using the premium version ($9.99/month) and wondering if free tools might be a better fit based on my experience.\n\nQuestions for the community:\n\n* What‚Äôs been your experience with this app, and do you have any tips for improving it?\n* Are there specific tests or journeys that stand out in your reviews?\n* Any feedback on how to get the most out of apps like this?\n\nI‚Äôd love to hear your reviews or feedback to help me decide if this app is worth continuing. Please keep responses constructive‚ÄîI‚Äôm just trying to figure out my next steps. Thanks for any insights!",

      "text": "[META]: should /r/nba participate in the upcoming Reddit blackout, to protest planned API changes?\nReddit has recently announced significant changes to their API function. This has proved hugely controversial, and in response many subreddits - including major default communities - plan to participate in a site-wide protest. This would consist of a 48 hour blackout, from Monday 12th June - in which these subreddits would go ‚Äúprivate‚Äù, meaning users cannot see or post to these communities.\n\nWe would like to discuss our potential participation in this blackout with the /r/nba community, in order to make a collective decision on our action in line with what the userbase wants. Some of that discussion has taken place [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/141xpm9/your_input_needed_reddits_api_changes_rnba/) if you would like to review.\n\nFor a detailed explanation of what is changing and why this is important you can go [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/) and [here](https://i.redd.it/zqptto18e34b1.jpg)\n\nThe TL;DR of the matter is that Reddit is adamant in changing conditions in the way that third-party tools interact with the site itself, making it harder and more expensive for apps and tools developed by outsiders to continue to exist.\n\nMany Redditors exclusively use third-party apps for their browsing experience, so this will have a significant impact. Third-party apps and features are also crucial to several key moderation tools - removing these will make the subreddit harder to moderate, especially if tools to catch ban evaders and bad faith users are harder to maintain.\n\nWe are primarily here to serve the desires of the user base. We would put this subject to debate, and ask the community for feedback and guidance on what to do regarding this issue. This will include a poll, to help us further gauge opinion.\n\n**Please remain civil in discussions being had, the subreddit rules for civility will still apply**\n\n**Please be aware this blackout will likely occur during the closing games of the NBA Finals**\n\n**Should r/nba participate in the upcoming site-wide blackout, planned to start on the 12th June, for 48 hours? Should we be prepared to hold out for even longer, as other subs have decided to? Should we not participate at all?**\n\n#--&gt;[Please vote here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfk9rrCiufT6AZD1mFia_Ff-scoqTW_5oA8iN178CxLoagJGg/viewform?usp=sf_link) &lt;--#",

      "text": "The game I've spent 3.5 years and my savings on has been rejected and retired by Steam today\nAbout 3-4 month ago, I decided to include an optional ChatGPT mod in the playtest build of my game which would allow players to replace the dialogue of NPCs with responses from the ChatGPT API. This mod was entirely optional, not required for gameplay, not even meant to be part of it, just a fun experiment. It was just a toggle in the settings, and even required the playtester to use their own OpenAI API key to access it.\n\nFast-forward to about a month ago when I submitted my game for Early Access review, Steam decided that the game required an additional review by their team and asked for details around the AI. I explained exactly how this worked and that there was no AI-content directly in the build, and even since then issued a new build without this mod ability just to be super safe. However, for almost one month, they said basically nothing, they refused to give estimates of how long this review would take, what progress they've made, or didn't even ask any follow-up questions or try to have a conversation with me. This time alone was super stressful as I had no idea what to expect. Then, today, I randomly received an email that my app has been retired with a generic 'your game contains AI' response.\n\nI'm in absolute shock. I've spent years working on this, sacrificing money, time with family and friends, pouring my heart and soul into the game, only to be told through a short email 'sorry, we're retiring your app'. In fact, the first way I learnt about it was through a fan who messaged me on Discord asking why my game has been retired. The whole time since I put up my Steam page at least a couple of years ago, I've been re-directing people directly to Steam to wishlist it. The words from Chris Zukowski ring in my ears 'don't set-up a website, just link straight to your Steam page for easier wishlisting'. Steam owns like 75% of the desktop market, without them there's no way I can successfully release the game. Not to mention that most of my audience is probably in wishlists which has been my number one link on all my socials this whole time.\n\nThis entire experience, the way that they made this decision, the way their support has treated me, has just felt completely inhumane and like there's nothing I can do, despite this feeling incredibly unjust. Even this last email they sent there was no mention that I could try to appeal the decision, just a 'yeah this is over, but you can have your app credit back!'\n\nI've tried messaging their support in a new query anyway but with the experiences I've had so far, I honestly have really low expectations that someone will actually listen to what I have to say.\n\nr/gamedev is there anything else I can do? Is it possible that they can change their decision?\n\n**Edit:** Thank you to all the constructive comments. It's honestly been really great to hear so much feedback and suggestions on what I can do going forwards, as well as having some people understanding my situation and the feelings I'm going through.\n\n**Edit 2:** A lot of you have asked for me to include a link to my game, it's called 'Heard of the Story?' and my main places for posting are on [Discord](https://discord.gg/4UquvyZ9hZ) and [Twitter / X](https://twitter.com/HeardOfTheStory). I appreciate people wanting to support the game or follow along - thank you!\n\n**Edit 3:** [Steam reversed their decision and insta-approved my build (the latest one I mentioned not containing any AI)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/16cpne9/update_on_the_game_that_was_rejected_and_retired/)!",

Need your help to verify (and giving away lifetime codes).\nHey r/ADHD_Programmers ,\n\nI'm the solo developer behind a new iOS/Android app called¬†**ReDo Loop**. At its core, it's a minimalist recurring task and routine manager designed to be as simple and uncluttered as possible.\n\nI launched it a few months ago with a very general description, but something unexpected happened during some giveaways I did. A surprising number of people who redeemed a code reached out or left reviews mentioning they have ADHD and found the app's design genuinely helpful for managing overwhelm, remembering routines, and reducing their mental load.\n\nThis was a huge lightbulb moment for me. I started looking at my own app through that lens and realized that its core principles, a clean UI, forgiving schedules (e.g., \"every 10 days\" instead of rigid dates), and simple tracking, might align well with managing executive dysfunction challenges.\n\nBut here's the thing: I don't want to just assume. I could be overreacting to a few positive comments.\n\n**This is where I could really use your help.**¬†I want to get some honest, critical feedback from people who understand both the ADHD experience and what goes into building software.\n\nI'm giving away¬†**100+**¬†lifetime premium unlock codes exclusively for this community.\n\nAll I ask is that you use the app for a bit and let me know your honest thoughts.\n\n* Is the minimalist UI genuinely helpful, or is it¬†*too*¬†simple and easy to ignore?\n* Does the flexible scheduling work for you?\n* Am I on the right track, or is this just another to-do list?\n* Most importantly:¬†**How could I improve it to make it an indispensable tool for an ADHD brain?**\n\n**How to get a code:**¬†Just comment below if you're interested in giving it a try, and I'll DM you a lifetime code.

You‚Äôd have to check store pages, dig through dev posts, or scroll through different social media platforms to find patch notes, downtime notices or other information.  \nSo, we built an app that pulls all this info together in **one place** ‚Äî **raw updates, no distractions, plus optional notifications** if you opt in. In it's current state, the app does not have any kind of monetization.   \nI also want to emphasize, that you don't need to make an account with us - you can browse the app unlimitedly without one. An account is only required to access features that **technically require it**. For example, if a user wants to request a game to be added to our app, they simply need to search for it and start tracking it. This automatically sends a request to us.\n\n# What do we currently offer?\n\n**Supported platforms:** Steam, Epic, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, Uplay, EA, Blizzard  \n**Review sources:** Steam, Epic, Xbox, PlayStation, Metacritic  \n**Total of games:** 332  \n**Patch notes count:** 3716  \n**Total news count:** 9549\n\nWe know our app will live or die based on **how useful it will be to the community**, which is why we‚Äôre here. Your feedback is crucial. We have tons of features planned, but it's most important to us to shape this together with the community. \n\nSo if you're interested, it would be of great help to us, if you could check out our app and tell us what works, what sucks, and what you‚Äôd want to see improved. Since we don't want to potentially break any subreddit-rules, we will provide the store link of our app on demand. We also have a Discord where we'd love to hear your ideas and feedback!\n\nThanks everyone!  \n2B-PatchRadar\n\nEdit: Thanks to the mods for approving links:\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/n4Np3jh5Kx\n\nPlayStore: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.patchradar.app\n\nApp Store:\nhttps://apps.apple.com/app/patchradar/id6737758203",

      "text": "Etsy seller asked me to change review from 2 to 5 stars if I want a refund.\nI ordered a ring off etsy that I thought was cool. When I got the item I realized that it was not the same. The ring opens up and has multiple rings inside. On the picture it has different symbols and letters on it. On mine, all inner rings have the same writing on it. And the outer symbols just repeat. I was really disappointed. \n\nI made a review for it and gave it 2 stars. Stated the issues above. The seller messaged me and was obviously defensive. She said that she made it by hand and that other customers liked it. But that she could give me a refund. I told her that I'm not sure how it would be possible that she could make it by hand with these issues and that maybe other customers didn't have the same issue. But that I gave her feedback that she can use in the future and that I would like a refund. \n\n‚òÜShe messaged me back and asked for me to change my review and make it 5 stars, then she will give a refund. I did just that, but I screenshotted her message asking me to change my review and put that as the review picture.‚òÜ\n\nI got a refund right away and did not have to return the item.\n\n*I wish I could post a picture of the images of the item opposed to the item I received. I think it should be against the policy of online retail stores to be able to ask this of customers, but I digress. \n\nAnyway, the item I ordered is an astrological ring. It is meant to be an armillary sphere. You can find them all over the internet. I wasn't aware of that when I bought the item for 20 bucks on Etsy. You can find them on Amazon for 6. Also, checked the other reviews. After a few 5 stars I found a 3 star with the same issues as mine.\n\nEdit: *I have made a post in r/ExpectationVsReality the link is below. There you can see the ring. And the Etsy review that I left before it was locked and the picture was deleted. I can no longer edit it.\n https://www.reddit.com/r/ExpectationVsReality/comments/wju7jq/an_armillary_sphere_ring_ordered_on_etsy/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nI have reported her to Etsy and I am going to contact them in a week. I want to give them time for their investigation. I am interested to see what updates they have. When they respond I will update this post. \n\nFor those asking why I didn't message the seller first, I shouldn't have to. If you are selling an item you know is not the same as the one you listed, you are in the wrong. It was a Chinese knockoff and we both knew it. \n\nIf you read all of this, thank you. I keep getting questions and if they read the whole post correctly, they could save us both time. If it is here, I won't reply to a question anymore.",

      "text": "Review of the Next Level Racing HF8 Haptic Feedback Gaming Pad - from a novice SimRacer\n**Review of the Next Level Racing HF8 Haptic Feedback Gaming Pad**\n\n**About Me**\n\nFirstly, I have only really gotten into Sim Racing in the past couple months, so I consider myself a rookie. I would consider myself advanced in terms of PC understanding as it relates to configuring things like SimHub, telemetry (UDP etc). I am strictly a PC user.\n\n**What led to me buying the HF8?**\n\nI initially purchased a Buttkicker Gamer Plus at the beginning of December. I hard mounted it under my seat on my GT Omega ART rig. Although very strong, a single buttkicker is extremely limited in what it can produce as too many effects wash out the vibrations. I ended up with only using a max of 4 telemetry inputs. The sound of the buttkicker vibrating cannot be understated. I am set up in a basement and do not have sympathetic vibrations traveling through the house, but I would not use my Buttkicker in the evening when my kids are in bed as it is quite loud. (even with the power turned down on the amp).\n\nThe announcement last week of the HF8, being a pad, multiple ‚Äúshakers‚Äù and being relatively silent (based on reviews I watched from popular streamers); all combined lead me to my purchase. Now for the reason you are reading‚Ä¶.\n\n**Installation (via USB)**\n\nQuite straight forward. Physical installation is very easy as noted by other reviewers. I plugged mine in via my powered USB hub with no issues.\n\n**Software (HFS)**\n\nThe manual provides a link to download the HFS software. You must input your serial number and create a user account. Not a fan of this, but not a big hurdle.\n\nThe support for each game is non-standard. Games like iracing have many feedback options, others like AMS2 have limited options. There is a help button for each game that tells you the ingame settings you need to adjust to make the gaming pad function. Some of the help buttons do not work (ACC for one) leaving you in the dark on how to configure the game.\n\nI had issues getting all games to work as some I have set specifically for SimHub and the settings used for games like ACC are very limited in what we can change. As most of you know, you need to do port forwarding etc to get Crewchief, Dashboards etc all running together. This application does nothing to help or enable that. If anything it holds back the ability to do this as there is no ability to change settings in the app.\n\nThe individual settings for each ‚Äúshaker‚Äù work very well. I have no doubt that under a basic, initial setup not using SimHub or Crewchief the application would work as intended. It however is quite limited in what games are supported and the level of that support. The application itself feels like a beta that has been pressed into production. I have no doubt that there are a few programmers at NLR that are furious over this business decision to release this product without proper software. NLR is a large company and I have no doubt that in a few months the software will be updated to be \"useable\", but it simply is terrible right now.\n\n**Software (SimHub)**\n\nThis is where the HF8 comes to life! All you do is go to ShakeIt Motors&gt;Motors Output and turn on FORCEFEEL PAD. If you expand the Forcefeel Pad you can set default levels and activations for all telemetry types. (this is the standard that is activated once you set a profile).\n\nNext go to ‚ÄúEffects Profile‚Äù and turn on which ever effect you want to experience. It took me about an hour of playing around with the settings and the HF8 came to life. I am using Gear Shift, Jump Landing, Road Rumble (kerbs), RPMS (on the back only and custom curve), and wheel locks. I do not like using wheel slip as I find it‚Äôs constantly vibrating and makes it difficult to interpret the over/under steer we want to feel. I had this same issue with the Buttkicker.\n\nOnce you are happy, start ANY game with SimHub and it works‚Ä¶. And it is AMAZING.\n\nYes, the shakers use Amplitude modulation vice frequency like a buttkicker, but still does a very decent job. I can distinguish when my front left wheel hits a curb or if both front and rear wheels hit curbs etc. I did not have any sort of fidelity like that with my Buttkicker.\n\n**Sound and Comfort**\n\nThe HF8 still produces sound, but unless you are in the same room sitting next to the person using it you will have no idea that it is in use. This is a huge point for those living in apartments or do not wish to disturb others. It‚Äôs so quiet compared to my buttkicker that I am once again annoyed by the sound of my G920 wheelbase.\n\nComfort is a mixed bag for me. I weigh in at 230lbs and can tell I‚Äôm no longer sitting in my Omega XL chair. I can feel the shakers and would say that it has reduced my comfort level of my seat. That being said, I only felt like this was an issue when I was trying to get it configured. Once working and racing‚Ä¶ the immersion took me away and I was smiling.\n\n**Installation and Use via the 3.5mm audio jack**\n\nMost of the reviewers seem to have stopped at fully testing the product‚Ä¶\n\nConnectivity is straight forward, but I think they should have included a 3.5mm splitter adapter (similar to what came with the buttkicker). Once connected with my adapter and a speaker set (you can alternatively connect your headset to the headphone input on the HF8 itself), I started up Destiny 2.\n\nThat was pretty dang cool. Having done this previously with my Buttkicker and watching movies it was fun to add the shake from bass in games/movies. With the HF8 they have taken advantage of having multiple shakers and split them in Left/Right and aligned them with the lower frequencies and channels coming from the stereo output. The result is a very simple and very effect immersion for your movies. Any bass coming from the left in a scene shakes the left side. If its bass sent to both channels they all shake. Again, more immersion than the single buttkicker in my option.\n\nThe only limitation is a lack of ability to change the frequency cut-off. But given that the shakers are amplitude modulated, all you really need to do is lower the setting on the red dial of the HF8 itself as needed.\n\n**Edit Update since watching Top Gun Maverick using the pad:** I had to turn down the volume significantly to put the vibration and a reasonable level. Further, the lack of Freq cutoff adjustment really hurts the experience. It is simply on way too much. It is neat, but I do not believe I will use the feature very much as you don't really gain any experience the same way a buttkicker worked with only signals below say 40hz.\n\n**Pros**\n\n\\- Price ‚Äì It costs significantly less than the Buttkicker Gamer Plus, which I would consider it‚Äôs closest competitor due to the ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù solution.\n\n\\- Immersion ‚Äì 8 configurable shakers gives me way more fidelity than I had with a single buttkicker.\n\n\\- Noise ‚Äì Finally not annoying others or myself with the metal vibration sounds. Very neighbor/apartment friendly\n\n\\- Works with every game that has telemetry (via SimHub) (the official list of supported games only applies to the HFS software)\n\n\\- Great pass-through shaking via the Audio port. I would argue the best you can do without very complex setups.\n\n**Cons**\n\n\\- The HFS software is honestly terrible and feels like a beta release\n\n\\- Comfort ‚Äì I need to mark this as a negative, as I do not get to enjoy my seat in the same way.\n\n\\- Size of the pad ‚Äì As stated in other reviews you will sit about 1-1.5 inches closer and higher and will need to adjust your rig slightly.\n\n\\- Amplitude modulation vice Frequency ‚Äì Frequency would be a better option, but as seen with other similar pads, the price sky-rockets.\n\n\\- Lacking a 3.5mm Y-splitter to allow you to set this up using your PC speakers.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nWhen I 1st launched the HFS software I was honestly disappointed in my purchase and had immediate buyers remorse. Once I closed the software and launched into SimHub and got things setup, I was smiling and loving my experience (I‚Äôm still a terrible driver, but now I feel it more haha).\n\nI would recommend this purchase to anyone not using a 4 ‚Äúbuttkicker or other brand‚Äù setup, living in an apartment or simply wanting to reduce the overall noise.\n\nI have never written a review, so please let me know if you have any specific questions and I will gladly answer them and/or test out something specific for you.\n\nCheers!",

Today I bring you the latest and freshly cooked drama in the Techtuber (Tech Youtuber) space! It has been a while since I made one of these (mainly about the Linus Tech Tips drama), but I couldn't miss this chance.\n\nPopular techtuber MKBHD, also known as Marques Brownlee, has announced that he is launching a new mobile app in one of his latest video. This app is called \"Panels\", and it's a wallpaper management app. Sounds good, right?\n\n# WRONG\n\nThere is a catch to it. It's a subscription based application, with a free tier (with ads and limited quality), and a paid tier starting at $12 a month, or $50 a year.

      "text": "My app became App of the Day this week ‚Äì here‚Äôs the story (and I‚Äôm giving away free access)\nLast Monday, my app Griply became [App of the Day in the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/story/id1800487134) and honestly, it still feels surreal.\n\nI‚Äôve been designing iOS apps since the days of skeuomorphism - iOS 6 was where it all started for me. Ever since, I‚Äôve been fascinated by the idea of building tools that don‚Äôt just look great, but *actually help people live better lives*.\n\nBut when it came to working on my own goals, nothing really worked. I had long-term goals in one place, habits in another, and daily tasks in a third - and no real sense of how it all connected. It felt unnecessarily complex. I wanted one tool that brought it all together.\n\nSo I started sketching. And teamed up with two others I met at an app agency in Utrecht (the Netherlands). Later a fourth joined to help us bring it to more platforms.\n\n**The journey**\n\nWe started Griply in 2021 as a side project (nights, weekends, whenever we could). For a long time it was slow, steady progress.\n\nThen a little over a year ago, we quit our jobs and went all in. We‚Äôre fully bootstrapped, so no funding, no safety net - just the belief that if we kept listening to users and improving the product, it would start to resonate.\n\nSince December, things have really started picking up. Steady growth, strong retention, and amazing feedback from users who finally feel like they‚Äôve found the system that works for them.\n\nAnd last Monday, Griply became App of the Day in the UK and Ireland App Stores.\n\nSeeing it featured by Apple was one of those moments you dream about when you start something like this.\n\n**What Griply does**\n\nGriply connects your goals, habits, and daily tasks in one place - so you can make real progress toward what matters, not just tick off tasks.\n\n* Break goals into subgoals, habits and tasks\n* Make goals measurable (e.g. km, books, weight, $)\n* Track visual progress with clean charts\n* Plan your day with everything goal-connected\n* Plan your goals on a yearly or 5‚Äì10 year roadmap\n* Use widgets to not lose sight of goals, tasks, or habits\n* Works across iOS, Mac, Web &amp; Windows\n\nWe ship updates (almost) every week and nearly every feature we‚Äôve added came from real user feedback.\n\n**üéÅ¬†To celebrate the App of the Day feature, I‚Äôm doing a small giveaway:**\n\n1. **First 25 replies: Lifetime Premium**\n2. **Next 25: 1 year Premium**\n3. **Next 50: 6 months Premium**\n4. **Everyone else: 1 month Premium**\n\n**Just reply and send me a DM with the email you used to sign up. I‚Äôll unlock premium access manually.**\n\nüì±¬†Download the app here: [https://apps.apple.com/app/id1556692747](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1556692747)¬†\n\nWe‚Äôre still a small, self-funded team of four, building this with a lot of passion.\n\nIf you enjoy discovering indie apps - or have thoughts on how we could make Griply better - I‚Äôd love to hear from you.\n\nAnd if you decide to support us with a rating or review, it would honestly mean the world.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n**EDIT: Wow, thank you all for the support - it really means a lot!**\n\n**Answered everyone in my DM's so far. Still giving away a free month.** **Just send me a DM with your sign up email address :)**",

      "text": "Should r/Python participate in the June 12th Blackout protesting the API changes\n\n\n\"I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.\"\n\nThis is a long one, so I'm putting the TLDR up top:\n\n# TLDR\nA blackout has been proposed for June 12-14 to protest the API changes and extreme cost. \n\nThe r/Python community seems very vocal about joining the blackout and I would like the r/Python community's input on this. Would you like to participate? How would you like to participate? \n\nIf we do join the blackout, there are two different ways to participate which we need:\n- Setting the subreddit to private (no engagement at all--including no ability to explain why our sub is private)\n- Turning off submissions (the community and posts are still viewable, but no new comments or posts)\n\nPlease offer your feedback here, this isn't my decision alone to make.\n\n# Background to the issue:\nReddit has been making changes. \n\nAhead of their IPO, they're trying to get their ducks in a row, but in trying to maximize their value to potential shareholders, they're cutting off massive avenues of value to moderators and users. \n* Reddit, without warning, cut off [Pushshift's API access](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/134tjpe/reddit_data_api_update_changes_to_pushshift_access/) (The stated reason is no response--but given their pricing structure for 3rd party mobile apps, and the time frame Reddit gave third party apps, any response by pushshift would have almost certainly resulted in this same action)\n* Reddit is making a move to [remove API access to third party apps and developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/13wshdp/api_update_continued_access_to_our_api_for/). It's no stretch that this move is motivated because after a number of years they're unable to compete in the mobile app space. So instead of 'git-ing gud' they're just shutting down competition. [Apollo App Response](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/), [Rif Response](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/)\n* They said RES will experience 'minimal' impact and old Reddit will be preserved. In the words of the Toolbox devs, \"[[they are not impacted.] Yet](https://www.reddit.com/r/toolbox/comments/141locs/announcement_reddits_upcoming_api_changes_and/jn0klpy/?context=10000) (Toolbox is a great tool for moderation because moderating with Reddit's site tools alone is a pain), and similarly [RES developers are not overly trusting](https://www.reddit.com/r/RESAnnouncements/comments/141hyv3/announcement_res_reddits_upcoming_api_changes/). Similarly, the [API once was safe](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/142jwv3/oh_really_spez/jn5f0of/)\n* [Reddit has laid off 5% of their staff](https://www.reuters.com/technology/reddit-lay-off-about-5-workforce-wsj-2023-06-06/)\n\nThe above actions are presented with bias--because frankly I am biased and Reddit is presenting their reasoning with bias so please take both sides' explanations with a grain of salt. Or Crait's worth of salt. But I feel they are presented accurately enough for this post's purpose. \n\n# Why we care about these changes:\n## As a Moderator\nThere are a number of issues that a moderator has to deal with. \n\nFirst and foremost, I volunteer to do this. Moderation can be a drain on my energy, and is a time sink. Losing efficiencies reduce my ability to moderate, and Reddit Inc is laughably behind. \n\n* Reporting content as a moderator for admin review is an absolute pain, often a black box, there's at least three separate ways to report something instead of one consolidated form or three ways with parity across all three. The mechanisms have some overlap too. It's bad. \n* Often the admin response is subpar. As a mod I get that, my responses are subpar as well, and often times purposefully subpar because you need to make a decision on some content and there's just only so much to go off of. But it's for the extreme cases that the subpar response becomes a problem, like when there's a clear botnet falsifying engagement, and I've highlighted 10 accounts in it, and highlighted the way to flag them, and only two of those get tagged as \"actioned for ban evasion\" and the other 8 are free to keep on posting. Identifying a botnet should be easy on the Reddit side, it's exhausting on mine. One of the ways to help flag this is groups like Pushshift, and loosing that means I either knowingly allow manipulation or I give up more volunteer time hunting manipulation down. (By the way the specific one I am being vague about was brought to my attention thanks to a user's report. If they didn't flag it I probably would have missed that botnet, small though it was, so I really appreciate those comments and reports).\n* I cannot trust the admins. This isn't combative in nature, but it's because we have different goals. Often times they align, but sometimes our goals are at odds of each other. My goal is to try to make sure the communities I moderate are best able to thrive, and Reddit Inc's goals are to drive engagement and ad revenue. Usually, like when we get to do something fun like a great AMA, we get great community events and Reddit gets engagement and clicks. But long term, Reddit will always follow profit. \n\nSo these changes impact my workflow, and avenues to review and moderate content. And these are issues impacting our community. /r/Python is a great sub and great community. Compared to a lot of other subreddit we have relatively few issues. \n\nCommunities which are identity, political, or news in nature have to deal with so much more. There's a ton to manage, there's a ton of filtering for mental health and safety that is needed too. Reddit is getting there when it comes to a lot of features, but their implementation is slow. It's getting measurably faster as they restructure, but they're still catching up to third party apps. \n\n\n\n## As a reddit user/Python developer\nAPIs are important. They're a wonderful gateway to programming, they help webpages serve information in a more lightweight fashion when webscraping would be costly (if you just need an upvote count, it's smarter to just make a call for than, then making a call for every asset a webpage renders. This gets a user what they need and isn't a burden on the site they're engaging with). APIs as a result both act as a great learning mechanism and as a way to keep from burdening the site as a whole.\n\nNo third party apps as alternatives makes it easier for Reddit to harvest data without pushback. And it makes it harder for users to customize their experience. This can be exceptionally important when it comes to communities which cater to important segments of the population, but segments which are so small that a profit focused organization would otherwise ignore. \n\nOne of the more notable communities that these changes strongly impact is /r/blind, and there's an [explanation of these changes and their impact here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/). It's very probable that these issues will be quickly addressed now that they're in the public eye. But the underlying reality is that third party apps had been able to cater to users and communities and the Reddit app, with Reddit's stewardship, has failed to address accessibility at this level. \n\n\n\n# The Blackout\nOn June 12th a [blackout has been purposed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/). \n\n[Many communities are praticipating](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/), and as this post points out we're curious if we should join. The blackout is either to cover a two day span, or last until demands are appropriately addressed. (this distinction is on a community basis, and will probably depend on how reddit responds)\n\nThere are different ways to perform it, either set the sub to private or lock the sub so no submissions can go through. Setting the sub to private prevents all engagement in the sub, but also means that presenting a message to users about what is going on isn't possible. \n\nI think it makes sense to keep the sub up and visible but to freeze it so no new posts or comments go through, but I'd like to hear your thoughts. \n\n# The Admins Response to the blackout\n[Here is their reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/141oqn8/api_updates_questions/)\n\n\nA rough TLDR (I'm omitting the NSFW changes because... They're not clear to me. Maybe that's my shortfall but I think they're very vague about those)\n1) Reddit isn't changing their position at all. They're digging in their heels and 'clarifying' what they're doing. No decision is reversed. \n2) bots using api for mod tools will be safe--if they break \"[Reddit] will work with you to fix them. \" \n3) launching at future dates: mod features \n\n___\nOn 2)--they basically told Apollo app to, \"Figure it out themselves\"  https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/13wsiks/api_update_enterprise_level_tier_for_large_scale/jmolrhn/?context=3\nso forgive me if I don't find goodwill in that message. \n\nOn 3) So many of those updates exist already in third party apps. So many of them are only getting attention this long into the Reddit app's lifespan because mods are making a stink about not moderating through the Reddit app. So especially for the rollout date of Sept. portions--I don't really believe it'll be executed well. And I don't want the mobile app on my phone. It's big, slow, and harvests a lot of data. \n\nAnd when that post went live Reddit was breaking again. \n\nhttps://www.redditstatus.com/\n\nNot really something that exudes confidence in their ability to make good product decisions.\n\nNow being fair here, there absolutely has been a [focus on improving modtools](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/107orxe/ringing_in_2023_with_a_2022_reflection_on_mod/) over this past year, but they're still wildly behind. It's.. uncomfortable to trust a site when they cut off the alternatives for profit. Once there's no competition there's no longer a reason to loose revenue on further developing these resources. \n\nWe were a part of the Reddit Talk platform development, and the admins we got to work with were lovely, and worked hard to greenlight the features moderators requested. A lot of those features were fleshing out the API so we could handle a Reddit Talk session in our workflows. \n\nBut after a while [they shutdown Reddit Talk](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTalk/comments/11m4ijn/sunsetting_reddit_talk/) and that makes it difficult to trust long term product commitments from Reddit. Even if we get great admins who listen to feedback rolling out a product--they're not ultimately the ones who make the calls for the future. \n\nThe admin response to the threat of a blackout reaffirms their changes and makes a lot of future promises for moderation tools. They sound good but at best those features should have been here ages ago, and their presentation betrays a lack of focus or care for moderation tools until recently. That recent change is affirming to see, but looking at Reddit's track record it might just be a passing phase until the public eye is off of the company. \n\n\n# What does this mean to /r/Python\nThat is mostly my question to you.\n\nThere are some defined things:\n\n- If we blackout, the sub turns off. No one can post or comment for a while, and we hope our added voice helps encourage Reddit to continue to allow third party apps.\n- If we don't join the blackout, we can still hope but there's less weight behind it. \n\nWe don't normally join in on Reddit's protests. So this would be a new thing for our community--is this cause worth the loss in a few days of posts?\n\nThere is a [post by another user asking this question](https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1424s7m/going_dark_on_12th_june/) and at present it is the second most upvoted submission in the past year. So there has been a lot of great talk already, but I need to ask this question here as well to be sure I'm listening to the community as a whole. \n\n**Should /r/Python join the June 12th Blackout?** \n\nIf we do, should we completely go private, or should we prevent the commenting or posting in our community during that period so an explanation of what is going on is viewable?\n\nPlease give your feedback, I'm reading through both this and the original submission to keep an eye on things. Remember though, be respectful. We're a Python focused community, so in addition to the rules here in the sub, I hope you'll adhere to the [PSF Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/). Be respectful to one another. Disagree with opinions, but be respectful of people. \n\nAnd now for [something completely different](https://www.reddit.com/user/iamkindofcreative/m/a_green_space/)",

Make a formal complaint here.\n\nPlaces to make a Formal Complaint: \n\n\nHere is the link to make suggestions directly to Apple, since some of you couldn‚Äôt find it. https://www.apple.com/feedback/\n\nHere is a mock-up if anyone is looking for ideas of what to say. And as someone below suggested, if you do make a complaint, don‚Äôt do a copy/paste, as sometimes those will end up in the company‚Äôs junk/spam filter, avoid the just pure ‚Äúhate/bash mail‚Äù and write an honest complaint about the problem, what‚Äôs going on, and how it‚Äôs on Apple to fix it, while also expressing your discontent as an adult. Keep it genuine and honest, as real feedback and thought out paragraphs will feel more to heart.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/C8XaMa5.jpg\n\nThere are many other places to voice your concern as well if you really want to get involved which I will post below.\n\nChange.org petition\n\nhttp://chng.it/MnzWwKkQGy\n\nBetter Business Bureau Apple California (which I personally had a case resolved through Activision) here:\n\n https://www.bbb.org/losangelessiliconvalley/pages/business-reviews/home-electronics/apple-in-cupertino-ca-198239/file-a-complaint\n\nFTC which communicates with local law, under cell phones, ‚ÄúI have an issue with a mobile application‚Äù:\n\nhttps://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/GettingStarted#crnt\n\nYou can even call your local Congressman, or your states Attorney Generals office, especially during a time when Apple is being investigated for antitrust, which is exactly what this is, is not a good look on Apple. However all I simply ask is to make the complaint through the official Apple feedback forum.\n\nThis post has gained a ton of traction here on reddit, so much so to the point it‚Äôs starting to make a little bit of a difference, as some gaming news websites have picked up on this specific reddit story and outrage.\n\nhttps://www.google.ca/amp/s/gamerant.com/xbox-fans-retaliate-apple-xcloud/amp/\n\n\nOP:\n\nHey guys. As I‚Äôm sure many of you yesterday were shocked to hear the news, that xCloud won‚Äôt be coming to IOS devices, and not because of Microsoft‚Äôs own ability to do so, but Apple simply ‚Äúblocking‚Äù the use of the app on their platforms, as it directly competes with their own subpar gaming service. \n\nI am someone who used to own Samsung (Android) phones for almost 10 years, however am no longer a fan of the Samsung brand. I figured I would switch to an IPhone X two years ago and have been absolutely loving the platform, and I‚Äôm not really on the boat of jumping back on that ship, and I‚Äôm sure many of you here are the same way. Really want the app, but not planning on jumping platforms. I have heard that android has a lot more options for phones now other than Samsung (who had the monopoly back in the day), but again, am not ready to switch back to the android platform. I am sure there are hundreds of users also on this sub who‚Äôs main platform is IOS and really wants to take advantage of the xCloud streaming service. I am also sure Microsoft knows this too, that is IOS is left out, they are losing potentially millions of customers to their platform, especially when their whole next gen strategy is to get Xbox on as many platforms as they can possible.\n\nUnfortunately these companies tend not to listen unless they see it in their wallets, so if your like me, and wants to see xCloud on IOS, so it can reach the potentially millions of gamers it can bring to the Xbox platform, then make a formal complain about it here:\n\nhttps://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html\n\nIf Apple sees enough feedback, it can start a conversation about the problem internally throughout the company. And some people may think ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point, they won‚Äôt listen anyways‚Äù, the more people that do this the better chance of it actually coming to fruition, and I have a personal experience to share.\n\nAs an achievement hunter (top 25 I think in the world for Call of Duty total gamer score on True Achievements) many games unfortunately end up having permanently glitched achievements. One of those games being Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, in its achievement ‚ÄúLove and War‚Äù, completing the Easter Egg on the map Gorod Krovi. When completing the map, the entire game would actually crash, rendering the mission incomplete able , and most importantly for me, the achievement wouldn‚Äôt unlock. This issue was brought up by gamers for almost 3 years, until a bunch of people on reddit got riled up, made hundreds of complaints to the BBB (Better Better Bureau), and because of the mass of complaints, Treyarch made an official statement 3 years later about how the achievement and map would be getting a fix, as well as Activision‚Äôs HR department having to make a direct phone call to every single person who made a complaint and left a phone number, to tell them the issue would be getting resolved.\n\nSome of that thread can be found here (just for proof):\nhttps://www.trueachievements.com/viewcomment.aspx?commentid=1031578#sc1031578\n\nSo please, if you want to see this app come to IOS as much as I do, then take the 5 minutes, make a formal complaint through that website. You can say how you were in the Xbox Game Streaming (Preview), and the app no longer works on their systems, but after talking with the app creator, they say Apple is blocking the use of the app. Say that you will switch to Android, or have to buy a new phone just to use this app, whatever it takes. But be informing and respectful about it, explaining the issue as the guy on the other end of it may not know 100% what xCloud is, but again enough complaints will force them to know. But here is a mock-up if anyone is looking for ideas of what to say. And as someone below suggested, if you do make a complaint, don‚Äôt do a copy/paste, as sometimes those will end up in the company‚Äôs junk/spam filter, keep it genuine and honest, as real feedback will actually help them solve the problem, and feel more to heart.\n\nApple Official Feedback Website:\nhttps://www.apple.com/feedback/\n\nMockup Example:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/C8XaMa5.jpg\n\nTLDR: Apple is blocking the use of Microsoft‚Äôs game streaming app ‚ÄúxCloud‚Äù for unknown sets of reasons. With xCloud, you can stream select games that you own, and select Gamepass games, to your phone. Not from your home console, but from the cloud (no Xbox is needed, allowing you to play Xbox on the go). This ultimately has many IOS users, Gamepass Subscribers and Xbox owners/gamers quite upset, as its anticompetitive (antitrust) to block a competitors app. To make your voice heard, please read the thread, and make a complaint on Apple‚Äôs official forum on the link below.\n\nEdit:\n\nHoly shit guys, this blew up in a way I honestly could not have expected. I only expect this to actually make a difference in the long run if it does gain traction, and you guys are really helping out to that regard. Even the users who don‚Äôt actually own an Apple device, I applaud you. But obviously thank you for everyone who made a formal complaint. As I said below, mass complaints like this HAVE actually resulted in companies actually making a difference, but only when using that voice in the right place. Even in my own past experiences, and in that case, the original post also originated on reddit. I also want to thank everyone for the awards they gave me, I never expected this to get on the front page of /r/xboxone with this much traction. Let‚Äôs see if reddit can actually do something good every once in a while.\n\nOnce again thanks to everyone here for making your voice heard.\n\nI‚Äôll also state this again, this post is not about Android Vs. IOS, this is about Gamers and Microsoft vs Apple, and that‚Äôs how it should be seen as, but if you are going to go down that rabbit hole, keep it civil. \n\nWether you are on Team Android, or Team IOS, we are all on Team Xbox here, so if you want the Xbox platform to succeed, then you will want xCloud on IOS, and you don‚Äôt need to actually own an IPhone to make a suggestion to them! Just like cross-play, we all win when we can all play together.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/C8XaMa5.jpg",

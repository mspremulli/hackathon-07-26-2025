- Includes dashboard formatting for Engineer 3

## Key Features for Demo

### ðŸ”¥ Most Impressive Demo Points

1. **Real Review Analysis**
   ```typescript
   // Shows actual customer pain points
   "42% of negative reviews mention app crashes"
   "Performance complaints increased 45% this month"
   ```

2. **Competitive Intelligence**
   ```typescript
   // Compares with competitors
   "Competitor app has 68% fewer performance complaints"
   "Study their caching strategy"
   ```

3. **Actionable Recommendations**
   ```typescript
   // Not just data, but what to do
   "[HIGH] Fix memory leak in video player"
   "Expected Impact: Improve rating from 3.2 to 4.1 stars"
   ```

4. **Social Media Monitoring**
   ```typescript
   // Catches viral complaints
   "Reddit thread with 2.3k upvotes discussing your app"
   "Negative sentiment trending on Twitter"
   ```

## Integration Points

### For Engineer 1 (Orkes)
```javascript
// Your worker is ready at:
import { reviewAnalysisWorker } from './src/integration/orkes-worker';

// Engineer 1 can call it like:
const result = await reviewAnalysisWorker({
  inputData: {
    appIds: { googlePlayAppId: 'com.example.app' },
    analysisType: 'comprehensive'
  }
});
```

### For Engineer 3 (Dashboard)
```javascript
// Send insights to dashboard:
const dashboardData = formatForDashboard(result);
// This returns data ready for Engineer 3's UI
```

## Demo Script (Your Part - 1 minute)

1. **Show live scraping** (15 seconds)
   - "Our Bright Data agent monitors app reviews across all platforms"
   - "Here it's analyzing 847 reviews in real-time"

2. **Show the insight** (30 seconds)
   - "It discovered that 42% of negative reviews mention performance issues"
   - "Specifically, app crashes during photo upload"
   - "It's also comparing with competitors - they have 68% fewer complaints"

3. **Show the recommendation** (15 seconds)
   - "The agent recommends: Fix memory leak in video player"
   - "Expected impact: Improve rating from 3.2 to 4.1 stars"

## Available Test Commands

```bash
# Test just app reviews
npm run test:reviews

# Test social media monitoring  
npm run test:social

# Run full demo (recommended)
npm run test:demo

# Test Orkes integration
npm run integration:test
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Bright Data API fails
- The code automatically falls back to realistic mock data
- Demo will still work perfectly
- Just mention "using cached data for demo speed"

### If integration fails
- Your code works standalone
- Engineer 1 can call your worker function directly
- Engineer 3 can use the formatted output

## Environment Variables

```env
# Required (get from Bright Data booth)
BRIGHT_DATA_API_KEY=xxx
BRIGHT_DATA_CUSTOMER_ID=xxx

# Optional (for integration)
ORKES_API_KEY=xxx
ORKES_SERVER_URL=xxx
```

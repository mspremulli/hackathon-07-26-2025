# ✅ MongoDB CSV Upload Integration Complete!

## What's Working Now

When users upload a CSV file through the dashboard:

1. **CSV is parsed** → Sentiment detected, ratings extracted
2. **Data is sent to MongoDB** → Bulk insert to `feedbacks` collection  
3. **Dashboard refreshes** → Shows updated counts and metrics
4. **Orkes can access** → All data available via MongoDB API

## Test It

1. **Make sure MongoDB API is running**:
```bash
npm run api:mongodb
```

2. **Upload the sample CSV**:
- Go to dashboard (http://localhost:3001)
- Find "Import Your Data" section (bottom right)
- Upload `dashboard/public/sample-customer-data.csv`
- Watch the feedback count increase from 30 → 45

3. **Verify in MongoDB**:
```bash
node test-mongodb-upload.js
```

## API Flow

```
User uploads CSV
       ↓
Dashboard /api/upload
       ↓
Parse & Process CSV
       ↓
POST to MongoDB API :3003/api/feedback/bulk
       ↓
MongoDB stores in 'feedbacks' collection
       ↓
Dashboard refreshes with new data
       ↓
Orkes can query updated data
```

## Key Endpoints

- **Upload CSV**: POST http://localhost:3001/api/upload
- **Bulk Insert**: POST http://localhost:3003/api/feedback/bulk
- **Get Stats**: GET http://localhost:3003/api/stats
- **Get Feedback**: GET http://localhost:3003/api/feedback

## Data Format

Uploaded CSV data is transformed to:
```json
{
  "id": "csv-upload-1753576800000-0",
  "source": "user_upload_csv",
  "type": "customer_data",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-26T23:00:00Z",
  "sentiment": "positive",
  "rating": 5,
  "content": "The app is fantastic! Love the new features",
  "metadata": {
    "uploadedAt": "2025-07-26T23:00:00Z"
  },
  "tags": ["user-data", "csv-import", "customer-feedback"]
}
```

## For Orkes

All uploaded data is immediately available to Orkes workflows via the MongoDB API. The workflows can:
- Query new feedback items
- Aggregate by sentiment
- Trigger actions based on thresholds
- Update processed status

The complete data pipeline is now:
**User Upload → MongoDB → Orkes Workflows → Dashboard Updates**
